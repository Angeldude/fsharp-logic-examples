### Interesting changes from OCaml to F# ###

- OCaml exceptions changed to F# `'T option`.
  
    This only works sometimes -- when the exception doesn't return any (useful) information. When the exception does return information, it's necessary to use `Choice<_,_>`. Also, changing functions to use `'T option` or `Choice<_,_>` instead of exceptions can also alter their type signatures, which can cause the code to suddenly fail to compile.
- Preprocessor doesn't exist. i.e. camlp4 / camlp5
- OCaml top-level commands such as #trace and #install-printer don't exist.
	The OCaml REPL directive

		#install_printer my_printer;;

	in F# is

		fsi.AddPrinter my_printer;;		// my_printer : 'T -> string

### F# porting notes ###
 - Turned off F# warning FS0025 (about incomplete pattern matches); these are found extensively in the original code and we want to leave the code as-is for now, so the warning was disabled for the time being.
