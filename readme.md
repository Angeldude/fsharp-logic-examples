Logic Programming in F#
===
### Code and Examples from John Harrison's "[Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/index.html)"

### Interesting changes from OCaml to F# ###

- OCaml exceptions changed to F# `'T option`.
  
    This only works sometimes -- when the exception doesn't return any (useful) information. When the exception does return information, it's necessary to use `Choice<_,_>`. Also, changing functions to use `'T option` or `Choice<_,_>` instead of exceptions can also alter their type signatures, which can cause the code to suddenly fail to compile.
- Preprocessor doesn't exist. i.e. camlp4 / camlp5
- OCaml top-level commands such as #trace and #install-printer don't exist.

	The OCaml REPL directive:

		#install_printer my_printer;;

	has the equivalent F# (in F# interactive):

		fsi.AddPrinter my_printer;;		// my_printer : 'T -> string

### F# porting notes ###
 - Turned off the F# compiler warning `FS0025` (about incomplete pattern matches). These matches are found throughout the original OCaml code and eliminating them *correctly* would require extensive changes to the code; so, for compatibility purposes, the code has been left as-is and the warning disabled to promote readability.
 - Run a few examples with 10MB stack using `runWithStackFrame` in `initialization.fsx`. These examples result in stackoverflow exception in F# on Windows due to small 1MB stack (see extensive discussion [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7947446/why-does-f-impose-a-low-limit-on-stack-size)).
